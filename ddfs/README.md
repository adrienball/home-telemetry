# Notes
These DDF (Device Description File) files are derived from the [files provided on the deconz-rest-plugin repo](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/tree/master/devices/lixee).

DDF files must have the status "Gold" to be taken into account by deCONZ.
Custom DDF files must be placed in the dedicated deCONZ user directory: `~/.local/share/dresden-elektronik/deCONZ/devices/` and not in deCONZ app directory (`/usr/share/deCONZ/devices/`).
